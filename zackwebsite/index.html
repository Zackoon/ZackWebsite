        <h1>Hey!</h1>
        Thanks for visiting my website -- more updates are to come! 
        My name is Zack, and I'm a fourth year Computer Science and Data Science student at UC Berkeley.
        I love looking into new topics, and I'm currently doing computer graphics, computer vision, and 
        full stack development. 

        <br><br>
        This past summer, I worked as a <strong class="company">SWE intern at Amazon</strong>, 
        designing and implementing a data pipeline, intermediate database, website backend, 
        and a frontend dashboard that ingested 600 million records of Amazon.com pricing data 
        by the end of my internship.
        
        <br><br>
        Before that, I worked as a <strong class="company">SWE intern at Space of Mind</strong> (mental health startup) implementing a 
        prototype of their patient chatbot, semantically chunking their transcript data into a vector database, 
        and using LangChain to provide query context for GPT-3.5.

      <strong class="projects"><a href="https://github.com/Zackoon/ObjectColorSolidRenderer" target=”_blank”>What I'm currently building: An (eventually) open-source online visualizer for vision scientists to visualize 4D (or even N-D) object color solids.</a></strong>

      In order of recency, <strong class="projects">some projects I've worked on:</strong>

        </h2>
        <img src="/assets/TerrainWater.gif"></img>
        <p>
          Using OpenGL and shaders, I implemented moving water in the procedural terrain, complete with reflection and diffraction. Read more about the methodology in the link above (under the "Final" tab with the "Water" heading).

          Implemented:
          <ol>
            <li>User programs: terminal argument passing, process control syscalls, and file operation syscalls</li>
            <li>Threads: multithreading, strict priority scheduling, alarms</li>
            <li>Filesystem: buffer cache implementation, an extensible file system similar to FFS, and subdirectory traversal/path resolution</li>
