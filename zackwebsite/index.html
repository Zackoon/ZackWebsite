      <div class="info">Hey there, thanks for visiting my website -- more updates are to come! My name is Zack, and I'm a third year CS student at UC Berkeley. 
      <br><br>  
      I'm personally interested in exploring ways to use technology and data for organizations in the Tech-for-Social-Good space; however, I find interest in a lot of different domains! I have experience working as an EMT and a data science TA, which has made me realize how much I enjoy human-centric solutions and interaction. I have also stepped into full stack development, graphics development (I'm having fun with this website!), exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and model-building. 
      <br><br> 
      In order of recency, I've worked on <a href="https://devpost.com/software/let-them-cook-9yb6za" target=”_blank”>Let Them Cook (link to description)</a>, which recommends recipes based on images of food in your fridge, and <a href="https://d2eifirn80iw3n.cloudfront.net/" target=”_blank”> DittyCal (this one is deployed!)</a> which recommends music based on left and right swipes, like Tinder.
      <br><br>
      What I'm currently learning: Volleyball, Blender, Three.js, and Mandarin!
